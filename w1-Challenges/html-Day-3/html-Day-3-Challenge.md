HTML - Day 3 - Challenge:

Put together a basic HTML webpage structure with an appropriate use of Semantic HTML, alongside correct use of both the Class and ID attributes. 

Your webpage must include an embedded YouTube video and an embeded Google Map. 

Research "Favicons" and see if you are able to change the Favicon of your website.

Finally, utilise HTML validation to ensure that your HTML is error free.
