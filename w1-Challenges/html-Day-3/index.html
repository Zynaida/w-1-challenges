      <h2>Fruit and vegetables: are you getting your 5 A Day?</h2>

      <p>
        It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit
        and vegetables every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or
        juiced.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's evidence that people who eat at least 5 portions of fruit and
        vegetables a day have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some
        cancers.
      </p>

      <p>Make sure you are doing enough physical activity.</p>

      <h2>How to get more fibre into your diet:</h2>
      <p>
        Most of us need to eat more fibre and have fewer added sugars in our
        diet. Eating plenty of fibre is associated with a lower risk of heart
        disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and bowel cancer.
